# hello-world
this is my very first try. I've no idea what i am doing. am trying veheminantly to teach myself to code and it is not going well AT ALL! I suppose I am not the "learn as i go and teaching myself" type of personallity. Or maybe I am and just don't know how to teach myself? Or mayhaps I know how to teach myself, but deep in my subconsience I am self-sabotaging? Or I may just be a complete dumbass and am just now realizing? Whichever of those holds to be true, i would still LOVE to learn to code, and will continue to torcher myself until i am fluent in at least one language!!!
