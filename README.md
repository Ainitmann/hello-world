# hello-world
this is my very first try. I've no idea what i am doing. am trying veheminantly to teach myself to code and it is not going well AT ALL! I suppose I am not the "learn as i go and teaching myself" type of personallity. Or maybe I am and just don't know how to teach myself? Or mayhaps I know how to teach myself, but deep in my subconsience I am self-sabotaging? Or I may just be a complete dumbass and am just now realizing? Whichever of those holds to be true, i would still LOVE to learn to code, and will continue to torcher myself until i am fluent in at least one language!!! 

P.S.
  ANY advice will be G-R-A-C-I-O-U-S-L-Y graciously accepted,reflected upon, taken highly into concideration, and implemented! Thank You in advanced! For I will be conciderably greatfull!!!
  P.P.S.
        It seams as tho I have just been rambling since the sentence "this is my very first try" so as to not continue down this path of self hatred that i have so stubbornly set myself upon!


P.P.P.S.  
        What exactly does the p & the s in P.S. even stand for? I suppose I could google it. That would just be me procrastinating even more. Gotdamn, I am a procrastinating whore!!!
